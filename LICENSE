Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are informed of your rights when you distribute copies of the software.

Understanding the GPL requires the ability to consider the whole system. If some part of the system is free software, that gives you the freedom to control it, but if another part is proprietary software, that can make you dependent on the proprietary part. That is why we have developed this license so that you can use free software in a common system with proprietary software without putting your freedom at risk. The GNU General Public License is just one of several copyleft licenses.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
